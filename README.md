# SSB6final
\
A radio using a highly modified SSB6.1 kit.\
In my opinion the SSB6.1 was lacking in impedance matching between stages, had an IF that oscillated,  and AGC dependent upon the volume control. Although I had fun with the kit, I eventually stole most of the parts for other projects.  This is a return to the kit with a desire to turn it into something but not sure what.

Not complete.  Working on other things now.
